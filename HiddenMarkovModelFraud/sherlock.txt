TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM
MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND
PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION
AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER ALL EMOTIONS AND THAT ONE PARTICULARLY
WERE ABHORRENT TO HIS COLD PRECISE BUT ADMIRABLY BALANCED MIND HE WAS
I TAKE IT THE MOST PERFECT REASONING AND OBSERVING MACHINE THAT THE
WORLD HAS SEEN BUT AS A LOVER HE WOULD HAVE PLACED HIMSELF IN A FALSE
POSITION HE NEVER SPOKE OF THE SOFTER PASSIONS SAVE WITH A GIBE AND A
SNEER THEY WERE ADMIRABLE THINGS FOR THE OBSERVEREXCELLENT FOR DRAWING
THE VEIL FROM MENS MOTIVES AND ACTIONS BUT FOR THE TRAINED REASONER TO
ADMIT SUCH INTRUSIONS INTO HIS OWN DELICATE AND FINELY ADJUSTED
TEMPERAMENT WAS TO INTRODUCE A DISTRACTING FACTOR WHICH MIGHT THROW A
DOUBT UPON ALL HIS MENTAL RESULTS GRIT IN A SENSITIVE INSTRUMENT OR A
CRACK IN ONE OF HIS OWN HIGHPOWER LENSES WOULD NOT BE MORE DISTURBING
THAN A STRONG EMOTION IN A NATURE SUCH AS HIS AND YET THERE WAS BUT
ONE WOMAN TO HIM AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER OF DUBIOUS
AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY I HAD SEEN LITTLE OF HOLMES LATELY MY MARRIAGE
HAD DRIFTED US AWAY FROM EACH OTHER MY OWN COMPLETE HAPPINESS AND THE
HOMECENTRED INTERESTS WHICH RISE UP AROUND THE MAN WHO FIRST FINDS
HIMSELF MASTER OF HIS OWN ESTABLISHMENT WERE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB ALL
MY ATTENTION WHILE HOLMES WHO LOATHED EVERY FORM OF SOCIETY WITH HIS
WHOLE BOHEMIAN SOUL REMAINED IN OUR LODGINGS IN BAKER STREET BURIED
AMONG HIS OLD BOOKS AND ALTERNATING FROM WEEK TO WEEK BETWEEN COCAINE
AND AMBITION THE DROWSINESS OF THE DRUG AND THE FIERCE ENERGY OF HIS
OWN KEEN NATURE HE WAS STILL AS EVER DEEPLY ATTRACTED BY THE STUDY OF
CRIME AND OCCUPIED HIS IMMENSE FACULTIES AND EXTRAORDINARY POWERS OF
OBSERVATION IN FOLLOWING OUT THOSE CLUES AND CLEARING UP THOSE
MYSTERIES WHICH HAD BEEN ABANDONED AS HOPELESS BY THE OFFICIAL POLICE
FROM TIME TO TIME I HEARD SOME VAGUE ACCOUNT OF HIS DOINGS OF HIS
SUMMONS TO ODESSA IN THE CASE OF THE TREPOFF MURDER OF HIS CLEARING UP
OF THE SINGULAR TRAGEDY OF THE ATKINSON BROTHERS AT TRINCOMALEE AND
FINALLY OF THE MISSION WHICH HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED SO DELICATELY AND
SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE REIGNING FAMILY OF HOLLAND BEYOND THESE SIGNS OF
HIS ACTIVITY HOWEVER WHICH I MERELY SHARED WITH ALL THE READERS OF THE
DAILY PRESS I KNEW LITTLE OF MY FORMER FRIEND AND COMPANION ONE
NIGHTIT WAS ON THE TWENTIETH OF MARCH I WAS RETURNING FROM A JOURNEY
TO A PATIENT FOR I HAD NOW RETURNED TO CIVIL PRACTICE WHEN MY WAY LED
ME THROUGH BAKER STREET AS I PASSED THE WELLREMEMBERED DOOR WHICH MUST
ALWAYS BE ASSOCIATED IN MY MIND WITH MY WOOING AND WITH THE DARK
INCIDENTS OF THE STUDY IN SCARLET I WAS SEIZED WITH A KEEN DESIRE TO
SEE HOLMES AGAIN AND TO KNOW HOW HE WAS EMPLOYING HIS EXTRAORDINARY
POWERS HIS ROOMS WERE BRILLIANTLY LIT AND EVEN AS I LOOKED UP I SAW
HIS TALL SPARE FIGURE PASS TWICE IN A DARK SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE
BLIND HE WAS PACING THE ROOM SWIFTLY EAGERLY WITH HIS HEAD SUNK UPON
HIS CHEST AND HIS HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HIM TO ME WHO KNEW HIS EVERY
MOOD AND HABIT HIS ATTITUDE AND MANNER TOLD THEIR OWN STORY HE WAS AT
WORK AGAIN HE HAD RISEN OUT OF HIS DRUGCREATED DREAMS AND WAS HOT UPON
THE SCENT OF SOME NEW PROBLEM I RANG THE BELL AND WAS SHOWN UP TO THE
CHAMBER WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN IN PART MY OWN HIS MANNER WAS NOT
EFFUSIVE IT SELDOM WAS BUT HE WAS GLAD I THINK TO SEE ME WITH HARDLY A
WORD SPOKEN BUT WITH A KINDLY EYE HE WAVED ME TO AN ARMCHAIR THREW
ACROSS HIS CASE OF CIGARS AND INDICATED A SPIRIT CASE AND A GASOGENE
IN THE CORNER THEN HE STOOD BEFORE THE FIRE AND LOOKED ME OVER IN HIS
SINGULAR INTROSPECTIVE FASHION WEDLOCK SUITS YOU HE REMARKED I THINK
WATSON THAT YOU HAVE PUT ON SEVEN AND A HALF POUNDS SINCE I SAW YOU
SEVEN I ANSWERED INDEED I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT A LITTLE MORE JUST A
TRIFLE MORE I FANCY WATSON AND IN PRACTICE AGAIN I OBSERVE YOU DID NOT
TELL ME THAT YOU INTENDED TO GO INTO HARNESS THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW I
SEE IT I DEDUCE IT HOW DO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN GETTING YOURSELF
VERY WET LATELY AND THAT YOU HAVE A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT
GIRL MY DEAR HOLMES SAID I THIS IS TOO MUCH YOU WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE
BEEN BURNED HAD YOU LIVED A FEW CENTURIES AGO IT IS TRUE THAT I HAD A
COUNTRY WALK ON THURSDAY AND CAME HOME IN A DREADFUL MESS BUT AS I
HAVE CHANGED MY CLOTHES I CANT IMAGINE HOW YOU DEDUCE IT AS TO MARY
JANE SHE IS INCORRIGIBLE AND MY WIFE HAS GIVEN HER NOTICE BUT THERE
AGAIN I FAIL TO SEE HOW YOU WORK IT OUT HE CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF AND
RUBBED HIS LONG NERVOUS HANDS TOGETHER IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF SAID HE
MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE JUST WHERE THE
FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS
OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY
SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD
FROM IT HENCE YOU SEE MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN
VILE WEATHER AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOTSLITTING
SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY AS TO YOUR PRACTICE IF A GENTLEMAN WALKS
INTO MY ROOMS SMELLING OF IODOFORM WITH A BLACK MARK OF NITRATE OF
SILVER UPON HIS RIGHT FOREFINGER AND A BULGE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS
TOPHAT TO SHOW WHERE HE HAS SECRETED HIS STETHOSCOPE I MUST BE DULL
INDEED IF I DO NOT PRONOUNCE HIM TO BE AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL
PROFESSION I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THE EASE WITH WHICH HE
EXPLAINED HIS PROCESS OF DEDUCTION WHEN I HEAR YOU GIVE YOUR REASONS I
REMARKED THE THING ALWAYS APPEARS TO ME TO BE SO RIDICULOUSLY SIMPLE
THAT I COULD EASILY DO IT MYSELF THOUGH AT EACH SUCCESSIVE INSTANCE OF
YOUR REASONING I AM BAFFLED UNTIL YOU EXPLAIN YOUR PROCESS AND YET I
BELIEVE THAT MY EYES ARE AS GOOD AS YOURS QUITE SO HE ANSWERED
LIGHTING A CIGARETTE AND THROWING HIMSELF DOWN INTO AN ARMCHAIR YOU
SEE BUT YOU DO NOT OBSERVE THE DISTINCTION IS CLEAR FOR EXAMPLE YOU
HAVE FREQUENTLY SEEN THE STEPS WHICH LEAD UP FROM THE HALL TO THIS
ROOM FREQUENTLY HOW OFTEN WELL SOME HUNDREDS OF TIMES THEN HOW MANY
ARE THERE HOW MANY I DONT KNOW QUITE SO YOU HAVE NOT OBSERVED AND YET
YOU HAVE SEEN THAT IS JUST MY POINT NOW I KNOW THAT THERE ARE
SEVENTEEN STEPS BECAUSE I HAVE BOTH SEEN AND OBSERVED BY THE WAY SINCE
YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THESE LITTLE PROBLEMS AND SINCE YOU ARE GOOD
ENOUGH TO CHRONICLE ONE OR TWO OF MY TRIFLING EXPERIENCES YOU MAY BE
INTERESTED IN THIS HE THREW OVER A SHEET OF THICK PINKTINTED NOTEPAPER

THAN SIX FEET SIX INCHES IN HEIGHT WITH THE CHEST AND LIMBS OF A
HERCULES HIS DRESS WAS RICH WITH A RICHNESS WHICH WOULD IN ENGLAND BE
LOOKED UPON AS AKIN TO BAD TASTE HEAVY BANDS OF ASTRAKHAN WERE SLASHED
ACROSS THE SLEEVES AND FRONTS OF HIS DOUBLEBREASTED COAT WHILE THE
DEEP BLUE CLOAK WHICH WAS THROWN OVER HIS SHOULDERS WAS LINED WITH
FLAMECOLOURED SILK AND SECURED AT THE NECK WITH A BROOCH WHICH
CONSISTED OF A SINGLE FLAMING BERYL BOOTS WHICH EXTENDED HALFWAY UP
HIS CALVES AND WHICH WERE TRIMMED AT THE TOPS WITH RICH BROWN FUR
COMPLETED THE IMPRESSION OF BARBARIC OPULENCE WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY
HIS WHOLE APPEARANCE HE CARRIED A BROADBRIMMED HAT IN HIS HAND WHILE
HE WORE ACROSS THE UPPER PART OF HIS FACE EXTENDING DOWN PAST THE
CHEEKBONES A BLACK VIZARD MASK WHICH HE HAD APPARENTLY ADJUSTED THAT
VERY MOMENT FOR HIS HAND WAS STILL RAISED TO IT AS HE ENTERED FROM THE
LOWER PART OF THE FACE HE APPEARED TO BE A MAN OF STRONG CHARACTER
WITH A THICK HANGING LIP AND A LONG STRAIGHT CHIN SUGGESTIVE OF
RESOLUTION PUSHED TO THE LENGTH OF OBSTINACY YOU HAD MY NOTE HE ASKED
WITH A DEEP HARSH VOICE AND A STRONGLY MARKED GERMAN ACCENT I TOLD YOU

SAY TO ME THE COUNT SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS THEN I MUST BEGIN
SAID HE BY BINDING YOU BOTH TO ABSOLUTE SECRECY FOR TWO YEARS AT THE
END OF THAT TIME THE MATTER WILL BE OF NO IMPORTANCE AT PRESENT IT IS
NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT IT IS OF SUCH WEIGHT IT MAY HAVE AN INFLUENCE
UPON EUROPEAN HISTORY I PROMISE SAID HOLMES AND I YOU WILL EXCUSE THIS
MASK CONTINUED OUR STRANGE VISITOR THE AUGUST PERSON WHO EMPLOYS ME
WISHES HIS AGENT TO BE UNKNOWN TO YOU AND I MAY CONFESS AT ONCE THAT
THE TITLE BY WHICH I HAVE JUST CALLED MYSELF IS NOT EXACTLY MY OWN I
WAS AWARE OF IT SAID HOLMES DRYLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE OF GREAT
DELICACY AND EVERY PRECAUTION HAS TO BE TAKEN TO QUENCH WHAT MIGHT
GROW TO BE AN IMMENSE SCANDAL AND SERIOUSLY COMPROMISE ONE OF THE
REIGNING FAMILIES OF EUROPE TO SPEAK PLAINLY THE MATTER IMPLICATES THE
GREAT HOUSE OF ORMSTEIN HEREDITARY KINGS OF BOHEMIA I WAS ALSO AWARE
OF THAT MURMURED HOLMES SETTLING HIMSELF DOWN IN HIS ARMCHAIR AND
CLOSING HIS EYES OUR VISITOR GLANCED WITH SOME APPARENT SURPRISE AT
THE LANGUID LOUNGING FIGURE OF THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN NO DOUBT DEPICTED
TO HIM AS THE MOST INCISIVE REASONER AND MOST ENERGETIC AGENT IN
EUROPE HOLMES SLOWLY REOPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED IMPATIENTLY AT HIS
GIGANTIC CLIENT IF YOUR MAJESTY WOULD CONDESCEND TO STATE YOUR CASE HE
REMARKED I SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO ADVISE YOU THE MAN SPRANG FROM HIS
CHAIR AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THEN
WITH A GESTURE OF DESPERATION HE TORE THE MASK FROM HIS FACE AND
HURLED IT UPON THE GROUND YOU ARE RIGHT HE CRIED I AM THE KING WHY

SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN THAT OF A HEBREW RABBI AND THAT OF A
STAFFCOMMANDER WHO HAD WRITTEN A MONOGRAPH UPON THE DEEPSEA FISHES LET

MATTER OVER WITH YOU II AT THREE OCLOCK PRECISELY I WAS AT BAKER
STREET BUT HOLMES HAD NOT YET RETURNED THE LANDLADY INFORMED ME THAT
HE HAD LEFT THE HOUSE SHORTLY AFTER EIGHT OCLOCK IN THE MORNING I SAT
DOWN BESIDE THE FIRE HOWEVER WITH THE INTENTION OF AWAITING HIM
HOWEVER LONG HE MIGHT BE I WAS ALREADY DEEPLY INTERESTED IN HIS
INQUIRY FOR THOUGH IT WAS SURROUNDED BY NONE OF THE GRIM AND STRANGE
FEATURES WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TWO CRIMES WHICH I HAVE
ALREADY RECORDED STILL THE NATURE OF THE CASE AND THE EXALTED STATION
OF HIS CLIENT GAVE IT A CHARACTER OF ITS OWN INDEED APART FROM THE
NATURE OF THE INVESTIGATION WHICH MY FRIEND HAD ON HAND THERE WAS
SOMETHING IN HIS MASTERLY GRASP OF A SITUATION AND HIS KEEN INCISIVE
REASONING WHICH MADE IT A PLEASURE TO ME TO STUDY HIS SYSTEM OF WORK
AND TO FOLLOW THE QUICK SUBTLE METHODS BY WHICH HE DISENTANGLED THE
MOST INEXTRICABLE MYSTERIES SO ACCUSTOMED WAS I TO HIS INVARIABLE
SUCCESS THAT THE VERY POSSIBILITY OF HIS FAILING HAD CEASED TO ENTER
INTO MY HEAD IT WAS CLOSE UPON FOUR BEFORE THE DOOR OPENED AND A
DRUNKENLOOKING GROOM ILLKEMPT AND SIDEWHISKERED WITH AN INFLAMED FACE
AND DISREPUTABLE CLOTHES WALKED INTO THE ROOM ACCUSTOMED AS I WAS TO
MY FRIENDS AMAZING POWERS IN THE USE OF DISGUISES I HAD TO LOOK THREE
TIMES BEFORE I WAS CERTAIN THAT IT WAS INDEED HE WITH A NOD HE
VANISHED INTO THE BEDROOM WHENCE HE EMERGED IN FIVE MINUTES
TWEEDSUITED AND RESPECTABLE AS OF OLD PUTTING HIS HANDS INTO HIS
POCKETS HE STRETCHED OUT HIS LEGS IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND LAUGHED
HEARTILY FOR SOME MINUTES WELL REALLY HE CRIED AND THEN HE CHOKED AND
LAUGHED AGAIN UNTIL HE WAS OBLIGED TO LIE BACK LIMP AND HELPLESS IN
THE CHAIR WHAT IS IT ITS QUITE TOO FUNNY I AM SURE YOU COULD NEVER
GUESS HOW I EMPLOYED MY MORNING OR WHAT I ENDED BY DOING I CANT
IMAGINE I SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE HABITS AND PERHAPS
THE HOUSE OF MISS IRENE ADLER QUITE SO BUT
